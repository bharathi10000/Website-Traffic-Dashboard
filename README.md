# Website Traffic Analysis
Analyze website traffic data across various traffic sources, device categories, browsers, content segments, and geographic locations. Additionally, incorporate traffic trends observed over different time intervals.
## Short Description / Purpose
The Website Traffic Dashboard offers a comprehensive 360-degree view of total website session duration , Bounce Rate etc. , including insights into how sessions , bounce rate are varying for different dimensions such as device types , content types & different cities.
## Tech Stack
List the key technologies used to build the dashboard.


Example:
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:<br>

‚Ä¢	üìä Power BI Desktop ‚Äì Main data visualization platform used for report creation.<br>
‚Ä¢	üìÇ Power Query ‚Äì Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.<br>
‚Ä¢	üß† DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) ‚Äì Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.<br>
‚Ä¢	üìù Data Modeling ‚Äì Relationships established among tables (device lookup,geo lookup and Source lookup) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.<br>
‚Ä¢	üìÅ File Format ‚Äì .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.<br>

### 1. Business Problem:
  The business needed to analyze website traffic data across multiple dimensions‚Äîsuch as traffic sources, device types, browsers, content segments, and geographic regions. The aim was to identify user engagement patterns and areas of concern, like high bounce rates or low session durations, across different channels and platforms.

### 2. Goal of the Dashboard:
  To provide a 360-degree view of website performance, highlighting key metrics like session duration, bounce rate, and page views. The dashboard helps in understanding how these metrics vary by:<br>

-	Device type <br>
-	Content category <br>
-	Traffic source <br>
-	Geography (regions and cities) <br>

### 3. Walkthrough of Key Visuals (briefly):
-  Traffic by Device and Source: Compares session behavior across devices (mobile, desktop, etc.) and channels (organic, referral, etc.).
-  Bounce Rate Analysis: Visuals segmented by device type, content type, and traffic source, showing where bounce rates are highest/lowest.
- Trend Charts: Session duration and bounce rate trends over time (daily/monthly), helping detect seasonal patterns or weekly behavior shifts.
- Geographical Insights: Regional and city-level visuals showing total sessions, page views, session duration, and bounce rates.

### 4. Business Impact & Insights:
-	Bounce rate was highest for desktop users (~11.54%) and lowest for "Other" devices (~8.51%).
-	Referral traffic had the worst performance in terms of bounce rate and session duration; organic and social traffic performed better.
-	Bounce rate peaked on Sundays and rose from Monday to Thursday, suggesting possible content/timing misalignment.
-	Southern region and Chennai city had the highest session durations and page views, but also the highest bounce rates, indicating a need for deeper UX or content review.
-	April had the highest bounce rate; July the lowest‚Äîidentifying these trends could inform future content strategy.
